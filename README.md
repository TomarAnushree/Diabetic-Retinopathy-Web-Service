# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Web-Service

An automated classification system to predict patients 
with Diabetic retinopathy. This model can predict signs of DR with
accuracy of 83.04%, sensitivity of 81.51% and specificity of 85.19%.
I used Diabetic Retinopathy Debrecen Data Set from the UCI Machine 
Learning Repository to conduct analysis and model building.
